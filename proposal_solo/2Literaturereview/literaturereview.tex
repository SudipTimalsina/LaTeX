Blood donation is a critical aspect of healthcare systems, playing a vital role in saving lives and improving patient outcomes. Traditional blood donation methods often face challenges such as inadequate donor recruitment, inefficient communication, and insufficient donor-recipient coordination. The Blood Donating App addresses these challenges by creating a user-friendly platform that connects donors and recipients in real time. Similar apps and platforms, such as the American Red Cross Blood Donor App and BloodLink, have showcased the potential of technology in enhancing blood donation processes. These platforms enable donors to schedule appointments, receive notifications, and track their donations, contributing to improved donor engagement and retention.

Moreover, research by Khan et al. emphasizes the significance of mobile apps in addressing blood shortages during emergencies. The app's focus on education aligns with studies by Vafadar et al. who underscore the importance of awareness campaigns in dispelling misconceptions and encouraging voluntary donation. Furthermore, the integration of social media in the app draws insights from the study by Mehrotra and Rawat [5], highlighting the role of social platforms in mobilizing donor communities.
